# Task 3
# Fraction
# Create a class Fraction that represents the fundamental
# arithmetic logic for fractions (+, -, /, *) with appropriate
# error checking and handling. You need to add magic methods for
# mathematical operations and comparison operations between Fraction
# class objects.

# class Fraction:
#     pass

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     x = Fraction(1, 2)
#     y = Fraction(1, 4)
#     x + y == Fraction(3, 4)
